                    <p>I am a passionate programmer, determined to pursue my dreams of a career in the IT industry. Currently, I am a second-year student of Computer Science with a specialization in Business Applications at Wyższa Szkoła Biznesu – National Louis University in Nowy Sącz, studying entirely online from England. Although I live abroad, my education is based in Poland, allowing me to combine international experiences with the Polish education system.</p>
                    <p>I am currently working in a completely different field, but I am determined to make a change in my professional life and start a career in programming. Therefore, I am seeking an internship that will allow me to gain practical experience and develop my skills.</p>
                    <p>As part of my school assignments, I design applications in React JS. One of my projects is a Daily Check system for the sterilization department in a hospital. Additionally, in my Java classes, I created a Polish-English dictionary and worked with the Swing framework. My skills include technologies such as C++, Java, React JS, HTML, and CSS. I am also learning Node.js, which allows me to create complete web applications, from frontend to backend. I have basic knowledge of SQL, which enables me to work with databases.</p>
                    <p>I can design websites and web applications and understand UML diagrams, which helps me effectively plan and create application structures. I am extremely eager to learn, and after the semester ends, I plan to continue working on the Daily Check system to improve it. My goal is to deepen my knowledge of React JS and other modern technologies.</p>
                    <p>I understand that sharing code and teamwork are key elements of modern programming, which is why I intend to learn how to use Git. I feel that this is the right time to share my code and fully engage with the programming community.</p>
                    <p>My determination, passion, and willingness to learn make me an ideal candidate for an internship in programming. I look forward to the opportunity to develop and bring fresh ideas to the team I will have the pleasure of working with.</p>
